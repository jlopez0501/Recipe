### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I mainly focused on the requirements that were given ob the "Fetch Mobile Take Home Project" website. I also took a lot of time finding an aesthetic that I liked and that worked with the recipes given. Finding the right aesthetic/appearance is extremely important and I felt it was worth focuing on.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
Technically, I started this project only a couple days after I was given it, but I believe I probably only spent about a week on it in total. I would have liked to spend more time on it but work and personal obligations took up most of my time so I had to try to work on it in my off hours. I already mentioned this in the last section about priorities but I spent I allocated a lot of time finding the right color scheme. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I would say I made a pretty big trade-off by taking way too long on the colors. If I could start over I might just pick some pre-made ones off another recipe app and call it a day. Just so I could have more time to build more features.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The weakest part of my project is definitely the lack of features. Originally, I wanted a TabView with at least two additional tabs for the user, but due to the way I allocated my time I was unable to do that. 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I think my only final comments would be that I don't want this project to collect dust and be forgotten. I've had fun doing this because I enjoy cooking a lot! It forced me to think, "What kinds of features would I want in a cooking app?" I think the constraint of not being allowed to use any 3rd party libraries/dependencies also made this really hard. There's just so much out there that's already available to make your app stand out both visually and functionally and not being allowed to use any of them was a pretty big hurdle.
